All jQuery selectors start with a '$'

You can target elements by type $("button"), class $(".well"), or by ID $("#target3")

You can add a class using jQuery .addClass(), and remove one with .removeClass()

You can use the .css() function in jQuery to change the CSS of an element

jQuery's .prop() function allows you to change the proporties of elements

jQuery has a function called .html() that lets you add HTML tags and text within an element.

jQuery has a .text() function that only alters texts, not tags

.remove() removes an HTML element entirely. You don't pass anyting to the function

(ELEMENT).appendTo("#DIV-ID") is used to move elements from one place to the other.

.clone() clones an element. It is used with the .appendTo().

.parent() allows you to access the parent of whichever element you have selected. You then chain it to another function to change it. For example, .parent().css(edit)

    There is also .children()

jQuery uses CSS Selectors to target elements. target:nth-child(n) css selector allows you to select all the nth elements with the target class or element type.

    Here's how you would give the third element in each well the bounce class:
        $(".target:nth-child(3)").addClass("animated bounce");

You can use .target:odd or .target:even to target all of the odd or even numbered elements. jQuery is zero-indexed.
