<h2 style="color: red">Lorem ipsum</h2>
    This style property makes the h2 red. This way is called an inline style.

You can also make a style elemt which uses CSS
<style>
    h2 {color: blue;}
</style>
    This makes all h2 elements red.

Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements. They begin with periods.
This is called a class selector and begins with a period.
    <style>
        .red-text {
            color: red;
        }
    </style>

This is called a class declaration and does not require a period.
    <h2 class="red-text">This is now red.</h2>
---

<style>
    p {
        font-size: 16px;
        font-family: Monospace;
    }
</style>
    This makes all p elements the size 16px and with the font monospace

You can call a font from Google Fonts to use it in your website by putting its link on top of the code:

    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

    h2 {
        font-family: Lobster, Sans-Serif;
    }

        When you put another font, it is called degredation. If someone accesses the webpage and it can't get the font from google, it will use the font sans-serif instead.

Images have a "width: 100px;" attribute that can be used with CSS.
Border have "border-style;", "border-width;", "border-color;", "border-radius (which takes a px or %)", and a lot more.
You can have multiple classes on 1 element, just seperate the classes by a space as so:
    <h1 class="class-1 class-2 class-etc">
---

If you need to add an a element to your website but don't know where it will link to, use a hash to make it into a dead link.
    <a href="#">Pic of me winning a million dollars!</a>

Input tags are self closing.
Form tags can go around input tags and submit tag.
The required attribute makes it a required field.
    <form action="\link">
        <input type="text" placeholder="Name" required>
        <button type="submit">Press to submit!</button>
    </form>

Just how classes begin with a period, id's begin with a hash in the style brackets

An element's padding controls the amount of space between the element and its border.

An element's margin controls the amount of space between an element's border and other elements. Negative margins increases the space of that element.

You can specify padding and margin like: padding-top; margin-left;, .... OR
you can just say padding: 20px 40px 20px 40px.
    This works like a clock. It's top, right, bottom, left.
---

Every HTML page has a body CSS rule. Every other element will look like the body.
When you have styles that conflict, the 2nd thing will take precedence over the 1st. The browser reads from top to bottom.

In-line styles override CSS and the !important method overrides everything!
      .pink-text {
    color: pink !important;
  }
---

You can use hex for colors instead of their names
    color: #AF0B1A
You can also use rgb, which ranges from 0 to 255, 255 being the brightest
    color: rgb(0, 0, 0) -> black
    color: rgb(255, 255, 255) -> white
