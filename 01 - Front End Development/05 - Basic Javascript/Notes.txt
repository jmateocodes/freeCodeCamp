/*
JS has 7 types of data types: undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object

JS declares variables by putting "var" before it.
    var ourName;

Use \ to escape characters. For instance if you need to put quotes inside of a string.\r is for carriage return, \f is for form feed

Single and double quotes are identical in javascript.
