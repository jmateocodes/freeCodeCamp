/*
JS has 7 types of data types: undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object

JS declares variables by putting "var" before it.
    var ourName;

Use \ to escape characters. For instance if you need to put quotes inside of a string.\r is for carriage return, \f is for form feed

Single and double quotes are identical in javascript.

In js, once you declare a string, you cannot change their characters. String are "immutable".
    var myStr = "Bob";
    myStr[0] = "J";
    ^THIS CANNOT BE DONE. You have to assign myStr a new string.

Arrays don't have to be explicitly declared, and can contain multiple types.
    var myArray = ["Jump", 1];

Multi-dimensional array:
    var [["first", "array", ["second", "array"]];

Arrays are mutable, you can change them freely after declaring them.

.push() pushes an item to the end of an array
.push([...]) pushes an array into the end of an array
.unshift() adds an element to the front of an array
.pop() is to remove a value from the end of an array
.shift() removes the first value from the array
